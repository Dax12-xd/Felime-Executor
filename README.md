# How to use it
Press the insert key to show/hide the menu.
The menu is simple, there are lots of script modules already added into the menu, such as aimbot, jetpack, no-clip, and skin swappers. 
Although, if you want to add your own scripts, click the "Add script" button. The scripts should be in C++ or C#.
